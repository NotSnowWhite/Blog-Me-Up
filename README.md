## Description
After going to the URL, a user will see a pink homepage with 'Blog Me Up' in thick white lettering with a grey outline and underline at the top of the page. Immediately beneath that is the aqua blue form box with 3 inputs for title, username, and content respectively. The submit button at the bottom of the form spans the width of the form. Upon submission, the user is navigated to the purple blog page with 'Blog Me Up...Do it' is in pink lettering in the middle of the page. To the left of the nav bar are 2 buttons for going back a page and toggling between theme colors. Directly beneath that are the local storage inputs.
